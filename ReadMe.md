This is a program inspired by a Tratan Hacks Project created along with Sami Shariff and Kevin Qian.

The Goal of this Program is to be able to take in analyzed RTK data from Buggies, and to be able to process their movement along a map in a video format. Bare bones are done so far, and will work on expanding how many buggies can be recorded at once, and customizing color outputs, along with other things.
